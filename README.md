Meteor Falls
=======

Scripts for Meteor Falls v0.9

Requires 2.4.0 with SESSION fixes. It's expected that our [tiers](https://raw.github.com/meteor-falls/Server-Shit/master/tiers.xml) are used on the server.

### Includes
* A simple script to install the entire script onto your server (webcall.js)!
* Redesigned tours, completely redesigned from that old "vp style."
* Stability is important too! We work hard to minimalise errors.
* Completely overhauled Watch channel, with a much better design.
* Various new emotes with more to come!
* Calculator (via math.js) and in progress Feedmon game!
* Polls!
* Much more to come! (Stuff for users as well!!!)
