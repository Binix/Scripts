Meteor Falls
=======

Scripts for Meteor Falls v0.9

Requires 2.4.0 with SESSION fixes. It's expected that our [tiers](https://raw.github.com/meteor-falls/Server-Shit/master/tiers.xml) are used on the server.

### Includes
* Completely overhauled Watch channel, with a much better design.
* Various new emotes!
* Much more to come! (Stuff for users as well!)
